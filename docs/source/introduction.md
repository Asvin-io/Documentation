# Introduction

There was a time when making a fresh coffee was consisted of multiple task. One would go to market to buy fresh aromatic coffee beans, grind them and store the coffee powder in a jar. Afterwards, the next morning one would go to kitchen, brew a coffee and in the meantime get a newspaper from the front door. As you can presume it was a long process until one would sip a tasteful coffee. Fast forwarding to 2020, we have a smart coffee machine which interacts with the arm band to find out one's sleeping schedule and brew a coffee by the time one reach to the kitchen. Additionally, it can order your favorite coffee beans from the preferred seller automatically.

We are surrounded by many smart devices like a coffee machine. These smart devices are equipped with wireless communication protocols, such WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, LoRaWAN etc. Therefore, they can talk to each other. These smart connected devices are referred as Internet for Things (IoT) devices. The innovations in the IoT technologies have given rise to machine to machine communications. We are surrounded by IoT devices whether it be our home, city, work place or hospital. By 2030, the number of IoT devices and IoT market size are projected to reach 125 billion and 1.3 trillion USD respectively.

On one hand, the IoT devices simplifies the processes and consequently make our lives convenient on the other hand they poses greater security threats. For an example, if one hacks the benign looking smart coffee machine it could reveal your WLAN credentials, credit card details, sleeping pattern and much more personal data. On top of that it can be used as a bot to raise cyber security attacks. Such type of attacks have been increasing multifold with the exponential growth in the number of IoT devices. There are multiple reasons, such as weak default passwords, small encryption keys etc.

One of the major concern is the IoT devices do not have over the air firmware update mechanism. It is paramount to have a very well defined, secured process to make changes in the vulnerable firmware. The IoT devices are manufactured and managed by set and forget policy. Which means the IoT devices are configured at the start and then left alone for the life to fight against the security attacks. Nowadays, the technologies change so fast that it is of greatest importance to assess the threat landscape of IoT devices and update the firmware regularly with latest security patches.

In the last couple of years there has been development in the area of update platforms for IoT devices. There are some solution, such as Eclipse hawkBit,Mbed, and Mender.io. They address the existing problem but there solution is limited to particular micro-controller architecture, software stacks and industries. They are fundamentally designed and developed as centralized solutions which are prone to single point failure and do not scale very well. The following sections describe how Asvin platform differentiates itself from these solutions.
