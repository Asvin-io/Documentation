# Overview

Asvin is a platform underpinned by multiple decentralized technologies for distributing security patches for IoT devices with high level of security, scalability, confidentiality and resiliency. It can be utilized to support the whole gamut of IoT devices. The platform hides the complexities and intricacies of IoT devices to provide firmware updates securely and help in identifying the threat landscape by maintaining a secure chain of trust of firmware.

## What is Firmware Update?

### IoT device

An IoT device is a peace of hardware typically embedded with micro-controllers, sensors, communication modules, input/output peripherals, and software for the objective of collecting useful data from multiple processes and exchanging it with other devices connected over internet. The IoT devices are employed in smart homes, manufacturing plants, cities, hospitals, work places , virtually everywhere.

The examples of IoT devices are smart coffee machine, smart refrigerator, traffic monitor, elderly care monitor, smart door lock, air quality monitor, food quality monitor and the list goes on.

### Firmware

An embedded software running on an IoT device is called firmware. The IoT devices have a small footprint. Therefore, a full fledged operating system can not be run them. The IoT devices based on Arduino, ESP, TTGO, WeMoS developments boards run a standalone program. It is also possible to run deterministic multi-threaded programs using embedded RTOS such as Mbed, FreeRTOS on more powerful boards like Nucleo, NuMaker, PSoC.

### Firmware Update

It is a process of changing software running on IoT devices. This can be done by updating the complete firmware or applying delta changes to the firmware.

### Why is Firmware Update Useful?

We live in the world where technology is boon and curse at the same time. On one hand, technology makes our processes simple on the other hand manipulation of loopholes in the technology by blackhat result in huge financial and life loss. It is paramount to keep filling up these loopholes with the advancement of technology. IoT devices are also not untouched by these malicious attacks. Therefore, it is required to update the firmware up to date with latest security patches.
