Download and install the latest version of `postman <https://www.postman.com/downloads/>`_. The postman will be used to make http requests to asvin
servers. We have a `postman collection <https://github.com/asvin-io/asvin-tutorials/blob/main/Collections/asvin-platform-postman-collection.json/>`_ 
of asvin APIs. You could create a test workspace and import the collection. It is required for the getting started documentation. The following video 
shows the procedure.
