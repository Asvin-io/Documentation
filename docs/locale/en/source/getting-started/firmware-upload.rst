Firmware Upload
===============

If you have completed the device registration process, then you must have a device in your account. Next, you need a firmware for the device. This can
be achieved in two steps. Firstly, create a firmware group by clicking on create new file group button under Firmware menu. When you have a firmware 
group with a desired name then click on show button or on the name. It will show you list of firmware in the group. Obviously, it is empty now. 
Secondly, create a simple firmware and click on Upload new file button to upload it. The steps are shown in the video below.

You will have a firmware group and firmware in it at completion of the task. The firmware metadata will be stored on the distributed ledger and firmware
will be saved on the private distributed network powered by IPFS protocol.
